## Software Organization & Roadmap:

There are two projects within this repository:

* __mddf-lib__: this implements all core (i.e., *non-UI*) functionality that can be used to generate, validate, or transform MDDF files.
* __mddf-tools__: implements standalone applications for validation.

The applications in mddf-tools are implemented on top of mddf-lib and any developers intending to develop their 
own mddf support applications are encouraged to do the same.

The mddf-tools software currently implements two applications:

   - **Avails Validator Tool**: may be used to
      - validate an Avails file specified as either XML or XLSX
      - translate an XLSX-formatted Avails to the equivalent XML
      - translate an XML-formatted Avails to the equivalent XLSX
   
   - **Manifest Validator**: validates that a CMM, MMC, or MEC file conforms with:
     - the CMM schema
     - recommended 'Best Practices'
     - a specific *profile*
