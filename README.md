## <a name="h_News">What's New</a>

* **2017-May-01**: mddf-lib v1.1.3.rc8 is now available as an executable jar for testing and evaluation.

* **2017-Apr-21**: mddf-lib v1.1.3.rc6 is now available as an executable jar for testing and evaluation.

* **2017-Apr-18**: mddf-lib v1.1.3.rc4 is now available as an executable jar for testing and evaluation.

* **2017-Mar-29**: mddf-lib is now available as an executable jar. Processing of either Avails or Manifest files is supported.

* **2017-Mar-02**: mddf-lib v1.1.2 is now available. See Change Log for list of fixed bugs.

* **2017-Feb-13**: mddf-lib v1.1.1 is now available. This provides several fixes relating to the translation of Avails
from XLSX to XML. 

* **2017-Jan-30**: mddf-lib v1.1 is now stable. The validators based on this release are Manifest Validator v1.2.2 and 
Avails Validator v1.1. The Avails Validator now supports conversion of an XML Avails file to XLSX. The currently
supported conversions are:
  * from XML (v2.1 or v2.2) to XLSX v1.7
  * from XLSX (v1.6 or v1.7) to XML v2.2
  * from XLSX v1.6 to XLSX v1.7mddf-lib v1.

## <a name="h_Overview">Overview:</a>

This repository contains Java software supporting the creation and usage of MDDF files including

* Avails
* Common Media Manifest (CMM)
* Media Manifest Core (MMC)
* Media Entertainment Core (MEC)

Information on the various MDDF standards is available at <http://www.movielabs.com/md/>

## <a name="h_Status">Status and Relationship to Other MovieLabs Github Repositories:</a>

The software in this repository is intended to replace that contained in the following MovieLabs repositories:

* availslib
* availstool
* cpe-preprocessing

## <a name="h_Versions">Executables</a>

Binary releases are available in two forms:

* as Native Executables for Windows, OS-X, and Linux systems. Each executable is specific to the processing of either Avails or Manifest files. These may be downloaded from the MovieLabs web site. The latest stable releases are:

   * Manifest Validator: v1.2.4
   * Avails Validator: v1.1.2

* as an executable Java jar which supports the processing of either Avails or Manifest files. Jar files may be downloaded from the ./binaries directory of this repository.

Note that the executable jar provides all of the capabilities available via the two native excutable packages. In addition, the jar provides a command
line interface (CLI) that may be used either from a terminal window or in conjunction with scheduled jobs (e.g., via crontab).

Refer to ChangeLog.md for a list of specific enhancements and bug fixes for any given release.

## <a name="h_Roadmap">Software Organization & Roadmap:</a>

There are two projects within this repository:

* __mddf-lib__: this implements all core (i.e., *non-UI*) functionality that can be used to generate, validate, or transform MDDF files.
* __mddf-tools__: implements standalone applications for validation.

The applications in mddf-tools are implemented on top of mddf-lib and any developers intending to develop their 
own mddf support applications are encouraged to do the same.

The mddf-tools software currently implements two applications:

   - **Avails Validator Tool**: may be used to
      - validate an Avails file specified as either XML or XLSX
      - translate an XLSX-formatted Avails to the equivalent XML
      - translate an XML-formatted Avails to the equivalent XLSX
   
   - **Manifest Validator**: validates that a CMM, MMC, or MEC file conforms with:
     - the CMM schema
     - recommended 'Best Practices'
     - a specific *profile*
