The CLI version of the CMM Validator is primarily intended to be used to
run validation scripts. While all options that are available via the GUI
version of the software are supported, most options will need to be set 
in a script.

Command line options are, therefore, focused mainly on either specifying  
which script to run, controlling logging output, or querying the Validator
to determine its range of capabilities (e.g., which profiles are supported).

Example Usage:

  Runs a script with log output saved to the default file in CSV format:
  
          Validator -s ./myScript.xyz -l -logFormat csv
